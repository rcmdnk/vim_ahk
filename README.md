vim_ahk
=======

Setting file/exe file of AutoHotkey for Vim emulation.

vim.ahk is the setting file for [AutoHotkey](http://www.autohotkey.com/)(Autohotkey_L).

vim.exe is a standalone application made from vim.ahk.

## Installation
If you've already installed AutoHotKey, just open vim.ahk with AutoHotkey.

You can also use vim.exe, which can work standalone w/o AutoHotKey.

If you are running AutoHotKey with another script,
you can include it in your script using AutoHotKey...
Please put vim.ahk in `\Users\%username%\Documents`
or where the script is in,
and add the following line in AutoHotkey.ahk or your script:

    #Include  %A_ScriptDir%\vim.ahk

at the end of the <a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Scripts.htm#auto">Auto-execute section</a>.

## Applications
The default setting enables vim-mode for the following applications:

* Notepad (メモ帳)
* Wordpad
* TeraPad
* Windows Explorer
* Thunderbird (only sending window)
* Microsoft PowerPoint
* Microsoft Word
* Evernote

If you want to change applications, add `GroupAdd VimGroup` lines at the top of vim.ahk
(Window title/class can be seen by window spy in AutoHotkey), like:

    GroupAdd VimGroup, ahk_exe notepad.exe ; NotePad

## Verbose level
vim.ahk can show information of vim mode at different levels.

* 0 : Nothing
* 1 : Only mode in task tray tips.
* 2 : Mode and g-mode information, n (number of repeat) in task tray tips.
* 3 : Mode and g-mode information, n (number of repeat) in task tray tips and message box.

The default verbose level is 2.

## Main Modes
Here are the main modes.

|Mode|Description|

|Insert Mode|Normal Windows state|
|Normal Mode|As in vim, a cursor is moved by hjkl, w, etc... and some vim like commands are available.|
