# vim_ahk

Setting file/exe file of AutoHotkey for Vim emulation.

vim.ahk is the setting file for [AutoHotkey](http://www.autohotkey.com/)(Autohotkey_L).

vim.exe is a standalone application made from vim.ahk (available in [the releases page](https://github.com/rcmdnk/vim_ahk/releases)).

This is vim emulation for Windows.
If you are interesting in same settings for Mac,

## Installation

### Scripts

If you've already installed AutoHotKey, just open vim.ahk with AutoHotkey.

If you are running AutoHotKey with another script,
you can include it in your script using AutoHotKey...
Please copy vim.ahk and lib directory in `\Users\%username%\Documents`
or where the script is in,
and add the following line in AutoHotkey.ahk or your script:

    #Include  %A_LineFile%\..\vim.ahk

at the end of the <a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Scripts.htm#auto">Auto-execute section</a>.

### Executable

You can also use vim.exe, which can work standalone w/o AutoHotKey.

To get executable, go to [the releases page](https://github.com/rcmdnk/vim_ahk/releases)
and download the latest one.

## Applications
The default setting enables vim-mode for the following applications:

* Notepad (メモ帳)
* Wordpad
* TeraPad
* Windows Explorer
* Thunderbird (only sending window)
* Microsoft PowerPoint
* Microsoft Word
* Evernote
* Visual Studio Code
* OneNote
* TexWork
* TexStudio

(For LibreOffice, especially its spreadsheet calculator `Calc`, there is the [vibreoffice](https://github.com/yamsu/vibreoffice) extension.)
You can change them from the right click menu of task tray icon (find `VimMenu`-`Settings` in the list),
or launch the setting window by `Ctrl-Alt-Shift-v`.

If you want to change applications directly in the script, add `GroupAdd VimGroup` lines at the top of vim.ahk
(Window title/class can be checked by Window spy of AutoHotkey), like:

    GroupAdd VimGroup, ahk_exe chrome.exe ; Google Chrome

Or you can use GUI option setting described below.

The default setting of `VimSetTitleMatchMode` is 2, which makes matching methods as `Contain`.

If you set `OneNote`, all windows with a title containing `OneNote` (e.g. `XXX's OneNote`) will be included.
If you set `VimSetTitleMatchMode` as 3, only exact title of `OneNote` will be included.


Note: It may not work on OneNote. OneNote may has window name like **User's Notebook - OneNote**, instead of **OneNote**.

In that case, you need to check OneNote's window title with Window spy.

Window spy will give you about Window Title, Class and Process like:

    User's Notebook - OneNote
    ahk_class ApplicationFrameWindow
    ahk_exe ApplicationFrameHost.exe

If you add any of above lines to VimGroup, vim_ahk works on OneNote.
But if you set `ahk_class ApplicationFrameWindow` or `ahk_exe ApplicationFrameHost.exe`,
vim_ahk also works on other applications which use these Class/Process name (most of applications installed from Microsoft Store).
