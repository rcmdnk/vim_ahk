# vim_ahk

Setting file/exe file of AutoHotkey for Vim emulation.

vim.ahk is the setting file for [AutoHotkey](http://www.autohotkey.com/)(Autohotkey_L).

vim.exe is a standalone application made from vim.ahk (available in [the releases page](https://github.com/rcmdnk/vim_ahk/releases)).

This is vim emulation for Windows.
If you are interested in the same settings for Mac,
try Vim emulation for [Karabiner - Software for macOS](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/): [Karabiner-Elements complex_modifications rules by rcmdnk](https://rcmdnk.com/KE-complex_modifications/).

## AutoHotkey v1 or v2

This script is for AutoHotkey v2.

If you are using AutoHotkey v1, please use release [v0.13.2](https://github.com/rcmdnk/vim_ahk/tree/v0.13.2) (or [ahk_v1](https://github.com/rcmdnk/vim_ahk/tree/ahk_v1) branch).

## Installation

### Scripts

If you've already installed AutoHotKey, just open vim.ahk with AutoHotkey.

If you are running AutoHotKey with another script,
you can include it in your script using AutoHotKey...
Please copy vim.ahk and lib directory in `\Users\%username%\Documents`
or where the script is in,
and add the following line in AutoHotkey.ahk or your script:

    #Include  %A_LineFile%\..\vim.ahk

at the end of the <a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Scripts.htm#auto">Auto-execute section</a>.

### Executable

You can also use **vim_ahk.exe**, which can work standalone w/o AutoHotKey.

To get executable, go to [the releases page](https://github.com/rcmdnk/vim_ahk/releases)
and download the latest zip file.

Unzip the zip file, and place the extracted vim_ahk folder where you like,
then launch **vim_ahk.exe**.

> [!NOTE]
> place **vim_ahk_icons** folder in the same folder with **vim_ahk.exe**,
> otherwise, the tray menu icon feature does not work.

### Build executable from the source

Clone vim_ahk and go vim_ahk folder, and run **build.bat**.

* Double click the file
* Or run `.\build.bat` on PowerShell or Command Prompt.

You will find **vim_ahk** folder which contains **vim_ahk.exe** and **vim_ahk_icons**.

## Applications (VimGroup)
The default setting enables vim-mode for the following applications:

* Notepad (メモ帳)
* Wordpad
* TeraPad
* Windows Explorer
* Thunderbird (only sending window)
* Microsoft PowerPoint
* Microsoft Word
* Evernote
* Visual Studio Code
* TexWork
* TexStudio
* Q-dir
* OneNote
* Applications using ahk_exe ApplicationFrameHost.exe

You can change them from the right-click menu of the task tray icon
(find `VimMenu`-`Settings` in the list),
or launch the setting window by `Ctrl-Alt-Shift-v`.

If you want to change applications directly in the script, add `VimGroup`
variable before `Vim := new VimAhk()` in vim.ahk
(Window title/class can be checked by Window spy of AutoHotkey),
or write before including vim.ahk

Example line:

    VimGroup := "ahk_exe chrome.exe,ahk_exe firefox.exe"

Multiple applications can be written by a comma-separated.

> [!NOTE]
> This will overwrite the default applications. If you want to **add**
> these applications to the default applications, add following applications
> after your applications:
> 
>     ahk_exe notepad.exe,ahk_exe explorer.exe,ahk_exe wordpad.exe,ahk_exe TeraPad.exe,作成,Write:,ahk_exe POWERPNT.exe,ahk_exe WINWORD.exe,ahk_exe Evernote.exe,ahk_exe Code.exe,ahk_exe onenote.exe,OneNote,ahk_exe texworks.exe,ahk_exe texstudio.exe
> 
> Or you can use GUI option setting menu described below.

The default setting of `VimSetTitleMatchMode` is 2,
which makes matching methods as `Contain`.

If you set `OneNote`, all windows with a title containing `OneNote`
(e.g. `XXX's OneNote`) will be included.
If you set `VimSetTitleMatchMode` as 3, only the exact title of `OneNote` will be included.

It may not work on OneNote. OneNote may have a window name like
**User's Notebook - OneNote**, instead of **OneNote**.

In that case, you need to check OneNote's window title with Window spy.

Window spy will give you about Window Title, Class and Process like:

    User's Notebook - OneNote
    ahk_class ApplicationFrameWindow
    ahk_exe ApplicationFrameHost.exe

If you add any of the above lines to VimGroup, vim_ahk works on OneNote.
But if you set `ahk_class ApplicationFrameWindow` or `ahk_exe ApplicationFrameHost.exe`,
vim_ahk also works on other applications which use these Class/Process names
(most of the applications installed from Microsoft Store).

Examples of applications:

* Chrome: `ahk_exe chrome.exe`
* Firefox: `ahk_exe firefox.exe`
* Excel: `ahk_exe EXCEL.EXE`
* LibreOffice: `ahk_exe soffice.bin` (for all LibreOffice applications)

## Options

In addition to `VimGroup`,
there are the following options that you can set in your script.
All of these can be changed from the setting menu, too.

|VimGroup|Applications on witch vim_ahk is enabled.|See **Applications** section|

You can add your options before including **vim.ahk** in your script
in the auto execute section like:

    VimVerbose := 2
    #Include \path\to\vim.ahk

If you want to change them directly in the vim.ahk script,
add these variable before `Vim := new VimAhk()`.

> [!NOTE]
> These Vim variables will overwrite the default values and initial values.
> After checking these variables, the configuration file is read.
> If you have already run vim_ahk, the configuration file was created and all the settings were saved.
> To reflect the new settings, try `Reset` in the GUI option setting window.

> [!NOTE]
> VimIconCheckInterval example
>
> If you set VimIconCheckInterval as non-zero, the tray icon is changed
> when you change the mode or change the applications to vim_ahk enabled or not enabled ones.
>
> ![trayicon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rcmdnk/vim_ahk/master/pictures/trayicon.gif "trayicon")

> [!WARNING]
> VimChangeCaretWidth
>
> Caret width can be changed only on specific applications: Wordpad, Word, or OneNote.
> On Notepad or Explorer, the caret width is kept but does not change.
>
> For most other applications, the caret width is kept as the original width.
>
> When this option is enabled, the current window briefly loses focus when the mode is changed.
>
> If you enabled this option and change the caret width thick in the Normal mode, and disable the option,
> the cursor width is kept as thick.
> To reverse the caret width, re-enable the option and enter the Insert mode at the Wordpad or something to revert the caret width, then disable the option.

## GUI Option Setting Window

You can change these options from the right-click menu of the task tray icon
(find `VimMenu`-`Settings` in the list),
or launch the setting window by `Ctrl-Alt-Shift-v`.

![traymenu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rcmdnk/vim_ahk/master/pictures/traymenu.jpg "traymenu")

![settings_keys](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rcmdnk/vim_ahk/master/pictures/settings_keys.png "settings_keys")
![settings_applications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rcmdnk/vim_ahk/master/pictures/settings_applications.png "settings_applications")
![settings_status](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rcmdnk/vim_ahk/master/pictures/settings_status.png "settings_status")
![settings_configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rcmdnk/vim_ahk/master/pictures/settings_configuration.png "settings_configuration")

Here, you can add applications, change the mode change key, change the verbose level,
or import/export the configuration file.

If you import a configuration file, these settings will be enabled
only if you push the `Apply` or `OK` button.

If you push `Reset`, default settings will be shown in the window.
These settings will be enabled only if you push the `Apply` or `OK` button, too.

These **default settings** are overwritten by
your `VimXXX` options in your script described above.
(i.e. `Reset` will restore your options in the script in addition to
the default settings of vim_ahk.)

## Global shortcut keys

|Key|Function|
|:----------:|:-------|
|Ctrl-Alt-Shift-v|Launch GUI Option Setting Window.|
|Ctrl-Alt-Shift-s|Suspend/restart vim_ahk.|
|Ctrl-Alt-Shift-c|Show status check window. (Only on the VimGroup applications.)|

## Main Modes

Here are the main modes.

|Mode|Description|
|:---|:----------|
|Insert mode|Original Windows state|
|Normal mode|As in vim, a cursor is moved by `hjkl`, `w`, etc... and some vim-like commands are available.|
|Visual mode|Visual modes: Character-wise and, Line-wise. Block-wise visual mode is supported for now.|
|Command mode|Can be used for saving the file/quitting.|

The initial state is the insert mode, then `ESC` or `Ctrl-[` brings you to the normal mode.

In the normal mode, `i` is the key to being back to the insert mode.

`v` (and `Ctrl-v`), `V` and `Ctrl-v` are the key to
the Character-wise and the Line-wise
visual mode, respectively.

After pressing `:`, a few commands to save/quit are available.

## Available commands in the insert mode

|Key/Commands|Function|
|:----------:|:-------|
|ESC/Ctrl-[| Enter the normal mode. Holding (0.5s) these keys emulate normal ESC/Ctrl-[.|
|jj|Enter the normal mode, if enabled.|
|Custom two letters|If two-letter mapping is set.|

ESC/Ctrl-[ switch off IME if IME is on.
ESC acts as ESC when IME is on and converting instructions.
Ctrl-[ switches off IME and enters the normal mode even if IME is on.

Long press ESC (Ctrl-[) will send these original keys, if `VimLongEscNormal` (`VimLongCtrlBracketNormal` is not enabled (0).

If `VimLongEscNormal` (`VimLongCtrlBracketNormal`) is enabled,
a single press will send original keys
and a long press will change the mode to the normal mode.

If using a custom two-letter hotkey to enter the normal mode, the two letters must be different.

> [!WARNING]
> A character can be used only for one two-letter hotkey. If you specify `ab` and `bc`, `ba` (push `b` first and then `a`) does not work. If you push `a` first, then `ab` will work, though.

## Testing

Tests are run by executing `tests/run_vimahk_tests.ahk`. A notepad and vim window is opened, and vim_ahk is started.

The testing system used is a series of test cases in `tests/testcases.txt` representing keystrokes to send to vim_ahk. These are sent to the open vim and notepad windows, and the resulting text is compared.

The tests can be very flakey, so should be used as a guide and to execute code paths to check for errors. Tests should be run with a default ini.
